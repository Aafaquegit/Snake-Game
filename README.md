# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic and entertaining project that brings the iconic game to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a snake that moves within a grid, aiming to consume red-colored food items, and grows longer with each successful consumption. The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with the game board boundaries and the snake's own body.
